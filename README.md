Hi, I'm Zack Wilde (I don't play guitar, sorry)

<br>

I'm an environment artist, creating assets in blender and re-making materials from scratch in unreal engine to get some of the best graphics possible out of the quest 2. If you have a headset, check out the [game I worked on](https://sidequestvr.com/app/39927/fortune-on-the-frontier-demo) at High Level Studios.

<br>

I'm the type of person that sees something and goes "How do I make my own?"

That has happened to me many times over the years, I've made games, music, animations, even some YouTube videos back in the day that are hard for me to watch years later.

<br>

My introduction to modding was Half-Life: Alyx, I made a [CoD Zombies like mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2679553661) after searching it up and not finding anything.

*You should check out [BLOPS 17](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2129733498), somehow that mod didn't show up, and if it did my mod would not exist, because it was exactly what I was looking for, it's great.*

<br>

I started decompiling FlatOut 2 because it's a game I'm nostalgic for, and I was curious how it worked.

I didn't expect it but I really like making middle-ware. Anything that takes a tedious process and makes it easier, or takes a complicated syntax and simplifies it.

<br>

My end goal is to make software that is as easy to use as possible without limiting what you can do with it.

I also like writing documentation that makes sure no matter who you are, you know as much as I do by the end of it. That usually means it's long but hopefully I've made it interesting enough to go through
